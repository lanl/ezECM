#' Import p-values
#'
#' Imports and organizes observed p-values located in a `*.csv` file for training or categorization using an existing model.
#'
#' The purpose of this function is to give the user a way to import p-value data in which the data will be organized for use with the [cECM()] and [BayesECM()] functions.  Warnings are printed when potential issues may arise with the supplied file, and the function attempts to detect and correct simple formatting issues.
#'
#' Ideally, the user supplies a `*.csv` file which contains a header row labeling the columns.  Each column contains the p-values of a particular discriminant, and each row must correspond to a single event.  If training data is to be imported, the column containing known event categories is labeled `"event"`.  If new data is imported to be used with an existing model fit, the order of the columns in the `new.data` file must be the same as the `*.csv` file containing training data.
#'
#' @param file Character string providing name of `*.csv` file to be imported.  File name within current working directory or absolute path are acceptable.  Argument passed directly to [utils::read.csv()], see [utils::read.csv()] for details.
#' @param header Logical indicating if first row of supplied `*.csv` file contains column names.  See [utils::read.csv()] for details.
#' @param sep Character string indicating the field separator character for the supplied `*.csv` file.
#' @param training Logical indicating if the supplied `*.csv` file is to be used as training data.  Only serves to suppress warnings.
#'
#' @return A [base::data.frame()] of p-values with each row corresponding to a single event and each column corresponding to a particular discriminant.  If data labels are correctly provided in the supplied `*.csv` file, an additional column labeled `event` will hold these values.
